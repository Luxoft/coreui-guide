## Neptune UI V3

NeptuneUI is the reference UI for QtAuto as also for large scale Qt project. It is developed inside the QtAuto team to act as a demo but also as a reference architecture application.

The largest example of the CoreUI architecture is the [NeptuneUI](https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-apps/neptune3-ui.git/), which is part of thew QtAuto project.

It was tried for a long time to document NeptuneUI which was difficult as the software was moving. So the CoreUI architecture guide was creted as an idea how an architecture could be and the NeptuneUI ws then refctored to follow this CoreUI guide.

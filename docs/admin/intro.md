# Core UI Admin CLI

The `coreui-admin` command line script allows you to control your QtAuto installation or to crearte a new CoreUI project. QtAuto is a set of components on top of Qt5 which allows you to create a typical user interface for the automotive market.

To better support the market needs the script propagates an opinionated architecture called the CoreUI Architecture. The script is capable of building the underlying platform as also to generate CoreUI projects and core components of these projects.

You can read more about the CoreUI architecture in the CoreUI section of the guide.

The script supports your work-flow in several ways:

- Cloning, building the coreui repositories and Qt5 as also your custom projects
- Creating and running coreui based projects based on templates for single or multi-process architecture
- Adding core components based on the CoreUI architecture to a CoreUI project
- Running scripts to support your custom work-flow
- Managing your custom environment variable setup

You can read more about the individual features in the concepts section of the admin guide.

A separate chapter demonstrates the creation of a CoreUI architecture instance using a simple mental model.
